A prototype I built for [Matthew Smith](http://twitter.com/whale) back in the ol’ “Squared Eye” days. Weird fixed positioning shit. We both thought it was an incredibly terrible idea so the prototype got shelved. Nowadays the Teens are doing the exact same stupid shit with their 100% height “cover images” on their Hip and Cool marketing sites. SMH.
